Studify is a student portal that provides a workspace for students to provide tools to common tasks such as:
- To-do List
- Calculator
- Timer
- Dictionary
- Youtube Search
- Job Search

Link: https://studify-portal.herokuapp.com/

What I've Learnt:
- Combining JavaScript and Django
- Connecting the dictionary to 3rd party API
- Working with the Youtube API
- Writing webscraping algorithms on Indeed.co.uk
- Serving static files when deployed

What I need to learn:
- Figure out why my jobscraping function works locally but not in production
- Develop my frontend skills to become better with UI/UX
- Figure out storing and serving audio files for the timer

Tech Stack: Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Git, Heroku
