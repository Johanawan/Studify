Studify is a student portal that provides a workspace for students to provide tools to common tasks such as:
- To-do List
- Calculator
- Timer
- Dictionary
- Youtube Search
- Job Search

What I've Learnt:
- Combining JavaScript and Django
- Connecting the dictionary to 3rd party API
- Writing webscraping algorithms on Indeed.co.uk
